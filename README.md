## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the mental health of children worldwide. This study explores the differential effects of the pandemic on children with varying levels of trauma exposure and resilience. The findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed care and the need to consider children’s adjustment to trauma in service delivery.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study consists of 13,500 unique clients served by San Diego County Children Youth and Family Behavioral Health Services from March 2019 through February 2023. The data is divided into three groups based on the child's history of and adjustment to trauma:
- **No Trauma**: Children without any reported trauma history.
- **Low Impact**: Children with a history of trauma but showing good adjustment.
- **High Impact**: Children with a history of trauma and poor adjustment.

## Methodology
The study employs several key instruments and methodologies:
- **Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS)**: A tool used to assess the needs and strengths of children entering services.
- **Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-35)**: A screening tool used to identify psychosocial dysfunction in children.
- **ANOVA and Regression Analyses**: Statistical methods used to compare mean scores and examine group interactions over time.

## Results
The key findings of the study are:
1. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the mental health of all youth.
2. Youth with high trauma impact had significantly more needs and mental health symptoms.
3. Strengths served as a buffer, with higher resilience linked to better mental health outcomes.
4. The pandemic exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly for those with pre-existing trauma.
